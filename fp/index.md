## **SoilBON**

**SoilBON** is a global project focused on studying and *protecting* the living things in soil, like *tiny bugs, worms, fungi, and bacteria*. These soil organisms are really important because they help break down dead plants and animals, make soil healthier, help plants grow, and keep our environment clean.
What SoilBON Does:

    * Monitors Soil Life: SoilBON gathers data from all over the world to see what's living in the soil and how it changes over time.
    * Shares Knowledge: Scientists share this information to help understand how to keep soils healthy and productive.
    * Supports the Planet: Healthy soil supports food growth, clean water, and a stable climate.

**The Goal**:

**SoilBON’s** goal is to help protect the tiny, important creatures in the soil, which is very important for keeping our planet healthy and sustainable.

Basically, SoilBON is like a global "health check" for soil to make shure it stays full of life and continues to support everything above it!

## **SOLO / Soils For Europe**

What **SOLO** Does:

    * Checks Soil Health: SOLO studies soils across Europe to see how healthy they are and what problems they might have, like pollution or erosion.
    * Spreads the Word: It teaches people—like farmers, scientists, and government officials—why healthy soil is important for growing food, fighting climate change,  and protecting nature.
    * Finds Solutions: SOLO develops better ways to take care of soil, so it stays healthy and fertile.

The Goal:

The goal of **SOLO** is to make sure Europe’s soils stay healthy so they can continue to support life, agriculture, and the environment.

In short, **SOLO** is all about understanding and improving soil health to ensure a better future for everyone in Europe.
